# PLC-Project---Traffic-Light-Sequence-Control

What has been accomplished in accordance with the project objective:

                1. I developed a PLC ladder logic program to manage the traffic light sequence at a four-way intersection.
                2. The program ensures green lights stay active for 80 seconds, followed by yellow lights for 10 seconds.
                3. I implemented an adaptive mechanism where, if traffic is low in one lane, the green lights of the other lane activate before 90 seconds.
                4. On the west side, I incorporated a pedestrian button (X) that forces the green light to switch to yellow after 20 seconds to facilitate safe crossing.
                5. A reset button was added to allow for a full system reset.
                6. I modified the system to include a dedicated left turn signal from east to south for improved traffic flow.
